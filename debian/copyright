This package was debianized by Matthias Jahn <jahn.matthias@freenet.de> on
Fri, 21 Mar 2008 15:14:56 +0100.

It was downloaded from http://mono-project.com

Some files were removed to comply with the DFSG:
      vbruntime/Test/bin/nunit.framework.dll
      vbruntime/Test/bin/nunit.core.dll
      vbruntime/Test/bin/nunit.util.dll
      vbruntime/Test/bin/nunit-console.exe
      vbnc/vbnc/tests/Errors/2017-aspnet1.vb
A DFSG-compliant source package may be obtained using 
      debian/rules get-orig-source

The compiler needs to bootstrap using the pre-build binary 
class/lib/bootstrap/vbnc.exe, which requires 
class/lib/bootstrap/Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll in order to operate.

These binaries are used to compile the code in vbnc/* and vbruntime/*,
which in turn, produce their own vbnc.exe and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll.

Only the resulting binaries are included in packages - not the versions
used for bootstrapping.
